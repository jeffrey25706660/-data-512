# Human Centered Data Science - A1: Data Curation

The goal for this assignment is to analyze, and publish a dataset of monthly traffic on English Wikipedia from January 1 2008 through August 30 2020. I retrieve 5 sets of data using Legacy Pagecounts and the Pageviews APIs and perform data cleansing and analysis to gain deeper understanding on total visits by device types. 

# Data Sources
Two different API endpoints, the Legacy Pagecounts API and the Pageviews API.

The [Legacy Pagecounts API](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#!/Pagecounts_data_(legacy)/get_metrics_legacy_pagecounts_aggregate_project_access_site_granularity_start_end) provides access to desktop and mobile traffic data from December 2007 through July 2016.

The [Pageviews API](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#!/Pageviews_data/get_metrics_pageviews_aggregate_project_access_agent_granularity_start_end) provides access to desktop, mobile web, and mobile app traffic data from July 2015 through last month.
